Max's Spotify Projects:
=========================
Playlist Viz: looking into dividing crate playlists into smaller playlists. Relatively simple, based off of some dimensionality reduction and some clustering/partitioning. Viz is currently simple but can experiment with it. Should try to pull together a few crate playlists and see what comes of it.

Playlist continuation: Trying to make playlists like some of the ordered playlists I included, from liked songs csv or combined crates. Needs some sort of playlist characterization or genre characterization or something along those lines.
